# Chat-server (java)

Network chat is my first "big" project developed in Java. It has a client-server architecture.

The application implements the functions of user authorization, connected users, private messages. In case of prolonged inactivity, the server disconnects users to save network resources. The data of registered users is stored in the MySQL database.

The project uses: Java IO Java Swing MySQL
